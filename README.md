# SmartShoe-for-visually-imapired

**ABSTRACT**


The development of smart shoes for blind people, which are equipped with
advanced sensors, alerting technology to help the visually impaired navigate their
surroundings. The shoes use machine learning algorithms to detect and recognize
objects, obstacles, and provide real-time audio feedback to the user. These smart
shoeshave the potential to greatly improve the quality of life and independence of
blind individuals by providing them with enhanced sensory information and
greater mobility.
The mini-project aim is to be to develop a wearable device that helps visually
impairedpeople see their surroundings. The device would use advanced computer
vision and machine learning algorithms to process visual information in realtime
and signal it to the user through a visual display. The shoes would also have builtin sensors that detect obstacles and alert the user in real-time, thus improving their
mobility and independence. The mini-project would require a multiple approach
involving expert in, machine learning, optometry, and electronic engineering. The
success of the project could potentially have a significant impact on the quality of
life for visually impaired people, allowing them to experience greater autonomy
and navigate the world with greater ease.
