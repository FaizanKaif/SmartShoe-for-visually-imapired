# SmartShoe-for-visually-imapired

**ABSTRACT**

<p align="justify">
The development of smart shoes for blind people, which are equipped with
advanced sensors, alerting technology to help the visually impaired navigate their
surroundings. The shoes use machine learning algorithms to detect and recognize
objects, obstacles, and provide real-time audio feedback to the user. These smart
shoeshave the potential to greatly improve the quality of life and independence of
blind individuals by providing them with enhanced sensory information and
greater mobility.
The mini-project aim is to be to develop a wearable device that helps visually
impairedpeople see their surroundings. The device would use advanced computer
vision and machine learning algorithms to process visual information in realtime
and signal it to the user through a visual display. The shoes would also have builtin sensors that detect obstacles and alert the user in real-time, thus improving their
mobility and independence. The mini-project would require a multiple approach
involving expert in, machine learning, optometry, and electronic engineering. The
success of the project could potentially have a significant impact on the quality of
life for visually impaired people, allowing them to experience greater autonomy
and navigate the world with greater ease.

**INTRODUCTION**

<p align="justify">
The number of visually impaired people is growing over the past decades. As
reported by the world health organization (WHO), about 285 million people
worldwide are estimated to be visually impaired. However, until now many
schools and jobs cannot accommodate them mainly due to lack of assistive
technologies and economic barriers. Even when the new aids or technologies
become available, they are either too expensive ($3000and above),or affordable
($200) but with single or limited task functions only. Among all assistivedevices,
wearable devices are found to be the most useful because they are hand free or
require minimum use of hands. Their main advantage is that the device points
naturally at the viewing direction, thus eliminates the need of additional direction
instructions, unlike other devices. This paperpresents a new design of smart shoes
that can provide assistance in multiple tasks while maintaining at a low building
cost. The design uses the Arduino Uno, an ultrasonic sensor, and a buzzer to
convey signal or warning to the user Through the integration of cutting-edge
sensors and tools such as Arduino, the project facilitates real-time object
detection, catering to the unique needs of visually impaired individuals.
Furthermore, the inclusion of a buzzer alert system ensures timely warnings,
enhancing safety and autonomy. Additionally, recognizing the challenges faced
by the hearing impaired, the incorporation of a vibration sensor enables tactile
feedback, allowing them to perceive alerts seamlessly. This innovative solution
not only mitigates existing barriers but also empowers individuals with
disabilities, fostering independence and confidence in navigating their
surroundings. This report elucidates the implementation, and impact assessment
of this groundbreaking endeavor, underscoring its significance in fostering an
inclusive society.
